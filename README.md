#### Figure 1
see `LikeFokkens/whole_genome_alignments` for pipelines to align genomes using nucmer, create coordinate files and sort these for plotting.  

See `LikeFokkens/genome-wide_plots` for scripts used for plotting presence-absence plots and `LikeFokkens/species_tree` for scripts used to plot the species tree.

A species tree was inferred as described in van Dam et al. (doi: 10.1111/1462-2920.13445) and saved in newick format.
