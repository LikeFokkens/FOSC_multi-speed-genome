## Figure 1  
see `LikeFokkens/whole_genome_alignments` for pipelines to align genomes using nucmer, create coordinate files and sort these for plotting.  

See `LikeFokkens/genome-wide_plots` for scripts used for plotting presence-absence plots and `LikeFokkens/species_tree` for scripts used to plot the species tree.

A species tree was inferred as described in van Dam et al. (doi: 10.1111/1462-2920.13445) and saved in newick format. 
  
Plotting the species tree is described in `plotSpeciesTree`, plotting presence-absence, color-coded according to sequence similarity or synteny (length of the alignment) is described in `presence-absencePlots`. Figure 1 was made by cropping the png generated as described in `presence-absencePlots` and positioning this adjacent to the tree. The order of rows in a presence-absence plot can be adjusted so that it matches the species tree.
